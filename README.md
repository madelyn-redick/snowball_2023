# The Five Factor Model of Personality and its Relationship to Drug Habits
For Northeastern University's Data Club Snowball Fal 2023 competition, we analyzed the relationship between quantified personality scores and drug use behaviors in order to understand which personality traits most influence one’s drug habits.

The 5-factor model of personality focuses on 5 traits:
- Nscore: neuroticism
- Escore: extraversion
- Oscore: openness to experience
- Ascore: agreeableness
- Cscore: conscientiousness

Results:
- For a full description of our analysis, refer to [The Five Factor Model of Personality and its Relationship to Drug Habits.pdf](https://github.com/madelyn-redick/snowball_2023/blob/main/The%20Five%20Factor%20Model%20of%20Personality%20and%20its%20Relationship%20to%20Drug%20Habits.pdf).
- Oscore demonstrated higher feature importance across various drugs, indicating a strong association between an individual's openness and their frequency of drug use.​
- Caffeine, crack, and amyl emerged as standouts with higher predictive accuracies across all models.
-  Our study successfully addressed the overarching objectives of identifying drugs with strong relationships to personality types and determining which personality traits exerted the most significant influence on drug habits. The results affirm the relevance of personality traits, particularly openness, in shaping an individual's proclivity for specific substances.


We were inspired by the study conducted by [E. Fehrman, A.K. Muhammad, E.M. Mirkes, V. Egan, and A. N. Gorban.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.06297). The dataset was obtained from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository.
